     <p> Introduction.<p>
<p>In the context of Vanuatu’s national REDD+ strategy, this self-directed research aims to use Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to model a potential land cover transition — more specifically, the transition from forest to coconut plantations. The decision to analyse this specific transition follows an understanding of the underlying causes of deforestation.
According to Geist and Lambin, “working behind the direct drivers of forest loss or degradation are underlying causes, which are often harder to identify and quantify, but which must be addressed in any effort to reduce pressures on forests. Underlying drivers are complex interactions of fundamental social, economic, political, cultural and technological processes that are often distant from their area of impact.” (Geist and Lambin, 2002, in Government of Vanuatu , 2022).<p>
<p>Focusing on the economic and political aspects of these underlying drivers led to the choice of modelling the forest-to-coconut-plantation transition. Based on interview data from the Vanuatu National REDD+ Strategy, one of the perceived drivers on Santo Island is governmental promotion of copra production. On the economic side, coconut plantations represent a key income source. According to specialists working on REDD+, “As typical in many Ni-Vanuatu communities, copra farming had been a main income source, but is highly vulnerable to price fluctuations and involves significant investment of human labor. Study participants explained how the entire Clan would work constantly in the coconut plantations to raise the needed funds for school fees.” (Carodenuto et al., 2022). In the same research paper, the authors also explain that copra production — when not integrated into agroforestry systems — falls under the business-as-usual scenario, in contrast to REDD+ strategies. In this context, market forces can influence deforestation: “The broad challenges to REDD+ reflect the situation in Vanuatu in that global markets have driven deforestation, and global markets must also play an important role in reducing deforestation.” (Carodenuto et al., 2022).
From this perspective, it becomes relevant to model the potential transition from forest to coconut plantations in a business-as-usual scenario.</p>

<br><br>
<p>Methodology.<p>
<p>The study area was selected through spatial observation. Various data layers were used to identify the zone of interest. The overlap of spatial data — such as recent deforestation (Hansen et al., 2013), coconut canopy (Descals et al., 2023), and Google Earth imagery — led to the choice of the southwestern part of Espiritu Santo Island (see Annex).
A workflow showing the data collection and analysis steps, along with screenshots of the process, is available below.</p>

<p>Limits.<p>
<p>This section is a personal reflection on areas for improvement in future research.
The limitations mainly concern the data and technical challenges. The Landsat data was constrained by cloud coverage, narrowing the selection options despite the availability of processing tools. I chose imagery with minimal cloud cover and applied treatments to reduce their impact.
For a more accurate model, it is recommended to calibrate using land cover data from three different time periods. As shown in the following example: “We used available data sources from the time interval 1983–2011. We included data from t1–t2 (i.e., 1983–2000) to calibrate the model and data from t2–t3 (i.e., 2000–2011) for validation.” (Di Lallo et al., 2017). Similarly, Freund et al. (2024) used two historical datasets to calibrate a deforestation risk projection model.<p>
<p>Through reading various studies on modelling deforestation risk in the context of REDD+, I understood the importance of the variables used. This project focuses on deforestation linked to coconut plantation expansion, and similar types of variables are relevant. However, in this model, only slope and elevation were used. I encountered technical issues while trying to include variables such as distance from roads or other disturbances. It would also be valuable to add further variables such as soil quality, or socioeconomic data, depending on the project objectives. Field data and a better understanding of the local human geography are also important to improve such a model.
There were also limitations related to land cover classification. The supervised classification of 2024 land cover showed some inaccuracy in the southwestern part of the map. After verifying with recent imagery, the classification using the Random Forest algorithm appeared to overrepresent coconut plantations, resulting in inaccuracies in the model’s final output.
I acknowledge the limitations of this model and the possible improvements needed to develop a more robust analysis.<p>
